    <string name="welcome_explaination">When you click \"Start tracking\" (or leave this app) a notification will appear in your notification tray, and your music listenign habits will be tracked. If at any time you want this to stop happening, hit the stop button and the app will exit and stop tracking. For the purposes of my research, it would really help me if you keep the app tracking! Thanks for helping.</string>
